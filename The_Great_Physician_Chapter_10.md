# The Great Physician - The Healing Touch of Jesus

## Chapter 10 - The Final Benediction

> "Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."  
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:23

The Great Physician's work in us is not only to heal, restore, and guide — it is to prepare us for the day when we will see Him face to face. Throughout this journey, His hand has been steady, His voice tender, and His power sufficient for every trial.

As we reach the end of this devotional journey, we are reminded that His ministry is unending. The Great Physician walks with us into eternity, His presence our constant comfort, His promises our anchor.

### Blessing for the Pilgrim's Path

The road ahead may still carry valleys and mountains, but the Great Physician assures us of His unfailing presence. Just as He has healed the body, mind, and spirit, He will continue to sanctify us until we are fully perfected in His glory.

Philippians 1:6 reminds us: *"He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."*

### A Benediction of Peace

- May His peace guard your heart.  
- May His joy fill your days.  
- May His love guide your steps.  
- May His truth keep you steadfast.  
- May His promise of eternal life strengthen your faith until the end.  

### Looking Forward

The Great Physician's final prescription is not for pain or illness — it is for a life lived in faith, love, and obedience, with our eyes fixed on Him. As we wait for His return, we do so with a song of gratitude, a heart of service, and a life surrendered.

### Reflection Prayer
