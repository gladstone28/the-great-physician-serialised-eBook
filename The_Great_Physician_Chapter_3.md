# The Great Physician - The Healing Touch of Jesus

## Chapter 3 - Healing the Body

> "He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.'"  
> — Mark 5:34

The Great Physician is not only the healer of hearts and the restorer of souls — He is also the mender of broken bodies. Throughout His earthly ministry, Jesus displayed power over sickness, disease, and even death. No illness was too advanced, no pain too deep, and no condition too hopeless for Him.

From the moment He stepped into public ministry, people brought their sick to Him in faith, and He never turned them away. The blind regained sight, lepers were cleansed, the paralyzed walked, and the deaf heard. Every healing was more than a demonstration of power — it was a revelation of His compassion.

### Faith That Reaches Out

One of the most remarkable healings in Scripture took place when a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years heard that Jesus was passing by (Mark 5:25-34). She had spent all she had on doctors, but instead of getting better, she grew worse.

In the crowd that day, she whispered a desperate thought to herself: *"If I just touch His clothes, I will be healed."* She pressed through the mass of people, stretched out her trembling hand, and touched the hem of His garment.

Instantly, her bleeding stopped. But Jesus wanted more for her than physical healing — He turned, called her *"Daughter,"* and gave her peace as well. The Great Physician meets us in our faith, even when it is as small as a single touch.

### Healing Beyond Human Limits

Some sicknesses seem beyond the reach of medicine. Doctors may say, *"There's nothing more we can do,"* but Jesus is not limited by human boundaries. When Jairus' daughter died, the mourners had already given up hope. Yet Jesus took her by the hand and said, *"Little girl, I say to you, get up!"* (Mark 5:41).

The girl rose to life, proving that for the Great Physician, nothing is impossible.

### Why He Heals

Jesus heals because it is in His nature to restore. His miracles were not random acts of kindness — they were signs of the Kingdom of God breaking into a broken world. Each healing pointed to the ultimate restoration we will one day experience when He returns and sickness will be no more (Revelation 21:4).

However, not every person in the Bible was healed instantly. Sometimes the healing came later, and sometimes it came in eternity. But whether physical healing is immediate or delayed, His promise remains: *"My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness"* (2 Corinthians 12:9).

### Reflection Prayer

*Great Physician, I bring You the parts of my body that ache, the symptoms that worry me, and the diagnoses that frighten me. I believe You have power over all sickness. Touch me as You touched the blind, the lame, and the sick of long ago. Whether You heal me instantly, gradually, or in eternity, I trust in Your love and care. Amen.*
