# The Great Physician - The Healing Touch of Jesus

## Chapter 7 - The Joy of His Name

> "The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe."  
> — Proverbs 18:10

There is power in a name — and no name carries more power, love, and joy than the name of Jesus. For the believer, His name is more than a word; it is a refuge, a source of strength, and a reason for rejoicing. When we speak His name in faith, we invite His presence, His authority, and His peace into our lives.

The Great Physician's name is filled with healing, for it represents the fullness of who He is. Every time we call on Him, we are drawing from the well of His mercy and the abundance of His grace.

### A Name That Saves

In Acts 4:12, Peter declares: *"Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."* The name of Jesus is not simply a title — it is the doorway to eternal life.

Just as a key opens a locked door, His name opens the way to forgiveness, freedom, and fellowship with God. When we call on His name in repentance and faith, we are rescued from sin's grip and welcomed into God's family.

### A Name That Heals

In Acts 3:6, Peter told a lame beggar, *"In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."* Immediately, the man's feet and ankles were strengthened, and he began to walk, leap, and praise God.

The power of His name brings both physical and spiritual healing. It is not a magic formula — the power is not in the sound of the name itself, but in the person of Jesus who stands behind it. His name carries His authority.

### A Name That Brings Joy

When the seventy disciples returned from their mission in Luke 10:17, they were overflowing with joy: *"Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name!"* The name of Jesus had given them victory over darkness, and their hearts were filled with praise.

We too can rejoice in His name — not because of our power or accomplishments, but because His name declares that we belong to Him, and nothing can separate us from His love.

### Carrying His Name Well

As followers of Jesus, we carry His name wherever we go. Our words, actions, and attitudes are a reflection of Him to the world. This is both a privilege and a responsibility. To honor His name is to live in a way that draws others closer to Him, not pushes them away.

### Reflection Prayer

*Jesus, Your name is my refuge, my strength, and my joy. I thank You that I can call on You at any time and know You hear me. Help me to honor Your name in how I live and to share its power with those who do not yet know You. Amen.*
