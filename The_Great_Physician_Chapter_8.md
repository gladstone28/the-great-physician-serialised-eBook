# The Great Physician - The Healing Touch of Jesus

## Chapter 8 - The Call to Follow

> "Then Jesus said to His disciples, 'Whoever wants to be My disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow Me.'"  
> — Matthew 16:24

The Great Physician not only heals our wounds — He calls us to walk with Him. His healing is never meant to leave us in the same place; it is a restoration that propels us into a new way of living.

When Jesus passed by fishermen on the shores of Galilee, He did not simply offer them a blessing — He gave them a call: *"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."* That call echoes to every believer today. Healing is the first step; discipleship is the journey.

### Leaving the Old Life Behind

To follow Jesus often requires leaving behind what is familiar. For Peter, Andrew, James, and John, it meant leaving their nets. For Matthew, it meant leaving his tax booth. For us, it might mean letting go of habits, relationships, or ambitions that hinder our walk with God.

It is not always easy, but when the Healer calls, His voice is worth obeying — for His path leads to life.

### Walking in His Steps

The call to follow is not a one-time event but a daily choice. Every morning, we decide again: Today, I will walk in His steps.

Following Jesus means learning from Him — not just in words, but in actions, priorities, and heart attitude. It means showing mercy when others show anger, choosing truth when lies seem easier, and loving when hate would be simpler.

### Serving Others with Compassion

Those who follow the Great Physician are called to carry His healing touch to others. In John 13:14-15, Jesus washed His disciples' feet and said, *"I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you."*

To follow Him is to serve humbly, love generously, and seek the good of others above ourselves. When we serve, we reflect the One we follow.

### The Promise for Those Who Follow

In John 12:26, Jesus promises: *"Whoever serves Me must follow Me; and where I am, My servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves Me."*

The journey may be challenging, but it leads to eternal fellowship with Him. The Great Physician's call is not just to heal us — it is to lead us to the place where we will be with Him forever.

### Reflection Prayer

*Lord Jesus, You have called me to follow You. Give me the courage to leave behind what holds me back and the strength to walk in Your steps daily. Teach me to serve with humility and to love as You have loved me. Amen.*
